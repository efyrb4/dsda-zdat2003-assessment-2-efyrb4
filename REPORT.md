# Report

**Note: The report should be somewhat self-contained and not require running code later to generate graphs. Whilst it should be possible to run the code and generate the graphs, the report should be able to stand alone and reflect the final version that you are happy to be marked.**

## Supervised ML

### Supervised ML Model

A short summary and rationale for the supervised ML model used in your experiments. Throughout this report, you can link to documentation and sources to avoid repeating information that is already widely available.

### Supervised ML Dataset

A very brief description of the dataset used for this technique. The datasets should not require any signifiant pre-processing to use with the model, so you can link to the documentation for the dataset here and provide only changes you have made or your usage.

### Supervised ML Experiments

**Repeat the following sections for each experiment you run.**

#### Supervised ML Experiment 1

##### Supervised ML Experiment 1 Description

A description of how you experimented with the model (e.g. parameter tuning) and the goal of the experiment. You can refer to other files in your project, but you should include here things like a table containing the configuration you employed, what you changed, and why you changed it. What exactly you include here will depend on the technique you've selected and the experiments you choose to run.

#### Supervised ML Experiment 1 Results

The results of the experiment. This should include any graphs or tables that you have generated as well as any relevant metrics or statistics that you have calculated. You can include here qualitative observations, comparisons with a baseline/other parameters (if relevant), etc. Consider your presentation of results carefully to show concise but clear information without just bombarding the reader with plots and text!

#### Supervised ML Experiment 1 Discussion

Here, you should include an analysis and evaluation of the results of your experiments. This can include broader considerations than the results, such as: a discussion on the significance and implications of the results with respect to the data and, critically, the model itself; an assessment of the model's performance linked to the experiments; and any observed trends or anomalies; reflection on the experiment's limitations and potential biases; any limitations of the experiment and any potential improvements that could be made; etc.

## Unsupervised ML

For the unsupervised ML part of the report, you can follow the same structure as for the [supervised ML part](#supervised-ml) above.
