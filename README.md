## Overview

This [README.md](../dsda-zdat2003-assessment-2-efyrb4/README.md) aims to provide an overview of the project structure with appropiate links to files used throughout the project.  

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```plaintext
dsda-zdat2003-assessment-2/
├── img/
├── src/
├── README.md
└── REPORT.md
```

- `img/`: Contains images used in the [REPORT.md](../dsda-zdat2003-assessment-2-efyrb4/REPORT.md), which are generated and saved from the [ML Experiments notebook](../dsda-zdat2003-assessment-2-efyrb4/src/ML_experiments.ipynb). All code is reproducible and re-running will lead to the same results but the saved figures can be seen within the [REPORT.md](../dsda-zdat2003-assessment-2-efyrb4/REPORT.md).

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project, this includes a [ML Experiments notebook](../dsda-zdat2003-assessment-2-efyrb4/src/ML_experiments.ipynb) and a [requirements](../dsda-zdat2003-assessment-2-efyrb4/src/requirements.txt) file which includes the dependecies needed to run the notebook. Within the source code [README.md](../dsda-zdat2003-assessment-2-efyrb4/src/README.md) I have outlined more detail on how the folder works.

- [README.md](../dsda-zdat2003-assessment-2-efyrb4/README.md): Reflects this current file, detailing an overview of the project structure. 

- [REPORT.md](../dsda-zdat2003-assessment-2-efyrb4/REPORT.md): Reflects the report of the ML & AI project. All  visuals and descriptions of the ML experiments are detailed within the report with thourough discussions of the results.
